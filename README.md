What is Notified
================

Notified is a very simplistic tool to assist developers in see what notifications are being posted on an OS X system.  This tool will expose the names of the notifications which you can add observers for in your apps.  Notified shows notifications for its own Workspace as well as those from NSDistributedNotificationCenter.
